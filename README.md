# Project 2

## Description
Coding Jobs is a site we have created to make it easier for the tech community to find and apply for jobs in their field. It requires a login so that applicants can view job listings and businesses can post said listings, using Bulma, Handlebars, Javascript, and some CSS we were able to bring this site to life.
